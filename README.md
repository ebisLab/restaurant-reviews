## Installation
* Download the contents of this repository by clicking "Clone or download." From here, you may clone the repo using SSH/HTTPS or download the files in a .zip folder.
* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
* With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000
* **Note**: Many editors have the ability to run their own live server using packages such as [Atom's Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server), eliminating the need to set up the SimpleHTTPServer. I find this way much easier.

## Instructions
* Once the index.html file opened, you can navigate the site.
